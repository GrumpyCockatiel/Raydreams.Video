## Description

The goal is to write parameterized animations using .NET 5 on a Mac or Linux. I quickly ran into the issue that all the existing packages required native dependencies to do the simplest things.

The first goal is just write frames of Windows BMP files to an AVI package (nothing compressed) using .NET 5 on a Mac.
